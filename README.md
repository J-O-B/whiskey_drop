## Welcome To Whiskey Drop!

### This is a project landing page.

This project was designed during the User Centric Front End module. This landing page was made initially using only bootstrap
before adding a more specific personal design to this landing page. 

To make this project individual and not a replica of the tutorial, I have added: 
1) CSS animation which will be available to desktop users.
  1.a) Hover over sections will show a radial-gradient to make the sections "glow"
  1.b) Hover over features will scale and transform the x/y axis of that specific feature.
  1.c) Hover over whiskey names, or origins in the "montly whiskey" section will make the text "float".
2) Text to replace the Lorum Ipsum text in the features section.
3) Personalized "cards" within sections to achieve the color styling I wanted.

Hope you like the landing page!
